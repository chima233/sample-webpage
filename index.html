            "Eko","Lag" "Lasgidi" are names often used to refer to Lagos, the
            largest city in Nigeria and the largest in sub-Saharan Africa.
            Without a doubt,Eko is one of the most beautiful cities in the
            world, not just because it houses so many good looking and
            hospitable people but also because it has beautiful places that
            attract foreigners and tourists.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            Third Mainland Bridge, Eko Hotel, National Museum, Tinubu Square,
            Silverbird Cinema and Galleria, National Arts, Theatre and many
            others places in Lagos belong to most photographed objects of
            Africa.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            As the commercial nerve centre of the Federal Republic of Nigeria,
            Lasgidi has continued to undergo mega transformations over the years
            just to keep pace with the changing times.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            Truth is, most Lagosians have not really come to appreciate the
            beauty and attractivness of this super town. There are thousands of
            reasons why it is so. Yes, because of the usual hustle and bustle in
            Lagos, people tend to pay more attention to how to make ends meet
            rather than appreciating the loveliness of the city. Despite having
            densely populated areas,the city is infamous for being one of
            Africa's most exclusive places to live in.
